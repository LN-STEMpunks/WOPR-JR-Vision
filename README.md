# WOPR-JR-Vision

Our 2017 vision code

Generated by GRIP $LINK, but then tweaked so that it works (TODO: Which lines)


## Setup

### On your laptop/development machine

To setup a development machine (your laptop), first clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/LN-STEMpunks/WOPR-JR-Vision.git && cd WOPR-JR-Vision`

Now, install requirements:

#### Linux (Deb based)

Run `./install.sh` and be guided through the process

#### macOS/Windows

We don't have a tested method to get it working on these platforms.

### On your coprocessor

#### Install

On your roborio/raspi/jetson/whatever you will need to install what `./install.sh` does.

We will include a raspi image with all this installed that you can download (coming later).

#### Deploying

To deploy to a raspberry pi, run

`./deploy.sh`

You can also use:

`./deploy.sh computername.local:~/path/to/vision/ [-p password]` (replacing with the raspis name or IP, and where you want to put the contents of `./src`)
